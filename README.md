🚀 Soberana - Internal Project Monitor
Soberana is a centralized project management dashboard designed to eliminate "blind spots" in internal workflows. It was developed to solve a critical demand for transparency, allowing managers to track project progress in real-time and identify team availability for new allocations.

The project has been fully anonymized for public demonstration on GitHub while maintaining its core operational logic.

💡 The Problem & The Solution
In many internal environments, managers struggle with:

Lack of Progress Visibility: No clear view of how close a project is to completion.

Allocation Uncertainty: Difficulty identifying who is busy and who is available for new tasks.

Fragmented Information: Data scattered across different tools or spreadsheets.

Soberana solves this by providing a "Single Source of Truth," aggregating squad performance and project health into one dark-themed, intuitive interface.

✨ Key Features
Based on the dashboard interface:

Project Monitor (Main Dashboard): A high-level view of all active projects with progress percentages and completion status (In Progress, Planning, Completed).

Workload Management (Carga de Trabalho): Specifically designed to show team capacity and streamline resource allocation.

Executive Presentation: A dedicated view for high-level reporting to stakeholders.

Multi-View Tracking: Includes Kanban boards, Sprints management, and Gantt Charts (Linha do Tempo) for chronological planning.

Squad Filtering: Ability to filter data by specific squads or view the entire organization at once.

📸 Interface Preview
The UI utilizes a modern Dark Mode to reduce eye strain for managers monitoring data throughout the day:

Project Cards: Display total progress (e.g., "75%"), pending work ("25% missing"), number of contributors, and deadlines.

Navigation Sidebar: Quick access to Goals Management, Workload, and Timeline views.

Real-time Status: Visual indicators for project categories like "Operations" or "Development".
